## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Step 1. Describe the main question you are testing.
What, if any, is the correlation between the location of the breach and the number of individuals affected?


# Step 2. Identify the variables that are relevant to the question.
- What are the types of those variables? How do you determine that?



- Describe why those variables may be relevant to this question and why other variables are not relevant 


# Step 3. Search for evidence by visualising, transforming, and modeling your data
(Check RDS 3, 5, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 for ideas and inspiration)


## 3.1 What type of variation occurs within each variable? 
Pick one variable and test the following:

### 3.1.1 Variable 1 (dep_delay, arr_delay)
```{r}
```


#### 3.1.1.1 Visualising distributions (Barcharts, Histograms, etc.) (RDS 7, RDS 3) -Qinyuan

- What chart is appropriate for this variable? Why?


- Which values are the most common? Why? 

- Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations? 

- Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them? 

```{r}

```
```{r}

```




#### 3.1.1.2 Unusual values (RDS 7, 5.2)

- Describe and demonstrate how you determine if there are unusual values in the data. E.g. too large, too small, negative, etc. 

- Describe and demonstrate how you determine if they are outliers. 

- Show how do your distributions look like with and without the unusual values. 

- Discuss whether or not you need to remove unusual values and why. 





#### 3.1.1.3 Missing values (RDS 5.2.3) 

- Does this variable include missing values? Demonstrate how you determine that. 

- Demonstrate and discuss how you handle the missing values. E.g., removing, replacing with a constant value, or a value based on the distribution, etc. 

- Show how your data looks in each case after handling missing values. Describe and discuss the distribution. 

#### 3.1.1.4 Does converting the type of this variable help exploring the distribution of its values or identifying outliers or missing values? (RDS 7) 

- What type can the variable be converted to? 

- How will the distribution look? Please demonstrate with appropriate plots.

#### 3.1.1.5 What new variables do you need to create from this? (RDS 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)

- List the variables

- Describe and discuss why they are needed and how you plan to use them. 

## 3.2. What type of covariation occurs between the two variables? (RDS 7)

### 3.2.1 Between a categorical and continuous variable or between two categorical variables or between two continuous variables -Julia

- Describe what type of visualization you can use and why.
It is a categorical(airports) vs continuous(delay time)

- Describe the patterns and relationships you observe. Could the identified patterns be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?

- Describe the relationship implied by the pattern? (e.g., positive or negative correlation)

- Calculate the strength of the relationship implied by the pattern (e.g., correlation) 

- Discuss how the observed patterns support/reject your hypotheses or answer your questions.

A histogram should be used to visualize the data - can handle continuous data types
the data is skewed to the right - there are a large number of flights with small delays, shifting down to a lower delay time


# Step 4. Summarize your findings 

- Summarize your findings about the questions you asked at the beginning. 

- Discuss if you have enough evidence to make a conclusion about your analysis.
