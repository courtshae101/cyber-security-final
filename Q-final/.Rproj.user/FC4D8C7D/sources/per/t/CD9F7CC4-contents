```{r}
breaches <- read_csv("Cyber Security Breaches.csv")
```
Question: Has the number of breaches increased overtime? Is there a trend?

#### 3.1.1.1 Visualising distributions (Barcharts, Histograms) (5 points)
```{r}
number_of_breaches <- breaches %>% 
  group_by(year)%>%
  summarise(freq = n())
ggplot(number_of_breaches, aes(year, freq)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity")
```
#### 3.1.1.3 Missing values (2 points) 
```{r}
missing <- is.na(breaches$year)
```

#### 3.1.1.5 What new variables do you need to create from this? (RDS 5.5, 5.6) (3)

- List the variables

- Describe and discuss why they are needed and how you plan to use them. 

# Step 4. Summarize your findings (20 points)

- Summarize your findings about the questions you asked at the beginning. (5 points)

- Describe and discuss how your observations support or reject your hypotheses or answer your questions. (5 points)

- Describe what new questions your analysis may generate. (5 points)

- Discuss if you have enough evidence to make a conclusion about your analysis. (5 points)
