## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Please load the nycflights13 package and other necessary packages and follow the following steps.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Step 1. Describe the main question you are testing.
How does the type of breach correlate with the number of individuals affected? 


# Step 2. Identify the variables that are relevant to the question.
- What are the types of those variables? How do you determine that?
```{r}
breach <- read.csv(file = 'Cyber Security Breaches.csv')
str(breach)
```
Type_of_Breach: discrete (chr) will change to factor
Individuals_Affected: continuous(int)


- Describe why those variables may be relevant to this question and why other variables are not relevant 
The origin is relevant to the question because we are testing to see which type of breach affects more people.
The individuals affected is relevant to the question because it is the measure we will use for comparisons between the type of breaches.


# Step 3. Search for evidence by visualising, transforming, and modeling your data
(Check RDS 3, 5, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 for ideas and inspiration)


## 3.1 What type of variation occurs within each variable? 
Pick one variable and test the following:

### 3.1.1 Variable 1 (dep_delay, arr_delay)
```{r}
breach1 <- breach %>%
    group_by(Type_of_Breach) %>% summarize(mean_indiv_affected = mean(Individuals_Affected,na.rm=TRUE),med_indiv_affected = median(Individuals_Affected,na.rm=TRUE))
breach1
```


#### 3.1.1.1 Visualising distributions (Barcharts, Histograms, etc.) (RDS 7, RDS 3) -Qinyuan

- What chart is appropriate for this variable? Why?
A box plot is the most appropriate for these variables so that you 

- Which values are the most common? Why? 

- Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations? 

- Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them? 

```{r}
ggplot(data = breach, mapping = aes(x = Type_of_Breach, y = Individuals_Affected)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  coord_flip() +
  ylim(0,100000)
```
```{r}
ggplot(breach, aes(x=Type_of_Breach, y=Individuals_Affected)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(x= 'Type of Breach', y= 'Individuals affected') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  coord_flip()
```




#### 3.1.1.2 Unusual values (RDS 7, 5.2)

- Describe and demonstrate how you determine if there are unusual values in the data. E.g. too large, too small, negative, etc. 

- Describe and demonstrate how you determine if they are outliers. 

- Show how do your distributions look like with and without the unusual values. 

- Discuss whether or not you need to remove unusual values and why. 

Boxplots are very useful to determine these kinds of values; you can see the minimum and maximum of the delaysfor each airport and which values do not lie within the interquartile by inspecting the boxes. When a data point is unreasonably large or small compared to box's range, you can conclude it is an outlier.
Again, you can determine outliers by seeing which data points do not lie within the max, min, and interquartile
range of the box plot.
It depends on the data, however since standard deviation and mean are very sensitive to unusual values,
it is typically good practice to remove unusual values if they will negatively affect your data and goal
during data analysis.



#### 3.1.1.3 Missing values (RDS 5.2.3) 

- Does this variable include missing values? Demonstrate how you determine that. 

- Demonstrate and discuss how you handle the missing values. E.g., removing, replacing with a constant value, or a value based on the distribution, etc. 

- Show how your data looks in each case after handling missing values. Describe and discuss the distribution. 

#### 3.1.1.4 Does converting the type of this variable help exploring the distribution of its values or identifying outliers or missing values? (RDS 7) 

- What type can the variable be converted to? 

- How will the distribution look? Please demonstrate with appropriate plots.

#### 3.1.1.5 What new variables do you need to create from this? (RDS 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)

- List the variables

- Describe and discuss why they are needed and how you plan to use them. 

## 3.2. What type of covariation occurs between the two variables? (RDS 7)

### 3.2.1 Between a categorical and continuous variable or between two categorical variables or between two continuous variables -Julia

- Describe what type of visualization you can use and why.
It is a categorical(airports) vs continuous(delay time)

- Describe the patterns and relationships you observe. Could the identified patterns be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?

- Describe the relationship implied by the pattern? (e.g., positive or negative correlation)

- Calculate the strength of the relationship implied by the pattern (e.g., correlation) 

- Discuss how the observed patterns support/reject your hypotheses or answer your questions.

A histogram should be used to visualize the data - can handle continuous data types
the data is skewed to the right - there are a large number of flights with small delays, shifting down to a lower delay time


# Step 4. Summarize your findings 

- Summarize your findings about the questions you asked at the beginning. 

- Discuss if you have enough evidence to make a conclusion about your analysis. 

```{r}
library(modelr)
mod <- lm(Individuals_Affected ~ Type_of_Breach, data = breach)

grid <- breach %>% 
  data_grid(Type_of_Breach) %>% 
  add_predictions(mod, "Individuals_Affected")

ggplot(breach, aes(Type_of_Breach, Individuals_Affected)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(data = grid, colour = "red", size = 4) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  coord_flip()+
  ylim(0,100000)
  
```
