## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Step 1. Describe the main question you are testing.
Which type of breaches affect the most individuals on average?


# Step 2. Identify the variables that are relevant to the question.
```{r}
breach <- read.csv(file = 'Cyber Security Breaches.csv')
#str(breach)
```

### Step 3 Visualize
```{r}
breach1 <- breach %>%
    group_by(Type_of_Breach) %>% summarize(mean_indiv_affected = mean(Individuals_Affected,na.rm=TRUE),med_indiv_affected = median(Individuals_Affected,na.rm=TRUE))
breach1
breach2 <- breach %>%  group_by(Type_of_Breach) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
breach2
```
Top 5 Most reported cases:
1. Theft
2. Unauthorized Access/Disclosure
3. Other
4. Loss
5. Hacking/IT Incident



```{r}
ggplot(breach, aes(x=Type_of_Breach, y=Individuals_Affected)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(x= 'Type of Breach', y= 'Individuals affected') +
  coord_flip()
```
Theft and Loss affected the most individuals overall

```{r}
ggplot(data = breach, mapping = aes(x = Type_of_Breach, y = Individuals_Affected)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  coord_flip() +
  ylim(0,100000)
```
Loss, Other and Unauthorized Access/Disclosure, Other had the largest average individucals affected per case

# Step 4. Summarize your findings 

- Summarize your findings about the questions you asked at the beginning. 

- Discuss if you have enough evidence to make a conclusion about your analysis. 

```{r}
library(modelr)
mod <- lm(Individuals_Affected ~ Type_of_Breach, data = breach)
summary(mod)
grid <- breach %>% 
  data_grid(Type_of_Breach) %>% 
  add_predictions(mod, "Individuals_Affected")

ggplot(breach, aes(Type_of_Breach, Individuals_Affected)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(data = grid, colour = "red", size = 4) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  coord_flip()+
  ylim(0,30000)
  
```

Although, the total number of individuals affected is greater for Theft and Loss, this can most likely be attributed to the greater number of cases reported, but in terms of the average number of individuals affected Loss, Other and Unauthorized Access/Disclosure, Other affect the most number of individuals per breach. Therefore, when improving cybersecurity, extra measures should be taken to prevent Theft and Loss because of the frequency of these breaches. Additionally, cybersecurity improvements should also focus on Unauthorized Access/Disclosure, Other and Loss, Other because each case affected significantly more individuals than other types of breaches.
